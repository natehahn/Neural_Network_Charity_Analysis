# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Greetings!!

I wish I could provide a very insightfull roll up of what this module entailed.  However, I cannot.  I do not understand ML in the slightest.  I was able to throw together the required code however I don't know what it means or really what it is doing.  I could not figure out how to change the variables in order to get accuracy over 75% because I wasn't sure what needed to be changed or where.  These last couple modules were far to complex to condense into a two week block for me to understand it.  I provided what I could in the attached ipynb file and will take whatever grade I can get.  Thanks!
